Welcome to Flower's documentation!
==================================

Flower is a friendly federated learning research framework. The design of
Flower is based on a few guiding principles which aim to make it
*customizable*, *extendable*, *framework-agnostic*, and hopefully also
*understandable*.


User Guide
----------

The user guide is targeted at developers who want to use Flower to bring
existing machine learning workloads into a federated setting. One of Flower's
design goals was to make this simple. Read on to learn more.

.. warning:: Flower's user-facing API is still in development and not
   considered stable. We welcome curious users to give it a try and share their
   experience with us.
