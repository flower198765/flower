# Flower Example for Federated Variational Autoencoder using Pytorch

This example demonstrates how a variational autoencoder (VAE) can be trained in a federated way using the Flower framework.

## Project Setup

Start by cloning the example project. We prepared a single-line command that you can copy into your shell which will checkout the example for you:

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/adap/flower.git && mv flower/examples/pytorch_federated_variational_autoencoder . && rm -rf flower && cd pytorch_federated_variational_autoencoder
```

This will create a new directory called `pytorch_federated_variational_autoencoder` containing the following files:

```shell
-- pyproject.toml
-- requirements.txt
-- client.py
-- server.py
-- README.md
-- models.py
```

### Installing Dependencies

Project dependencies (such as `torch` and `flwr`) are defined in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`. We recommend [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to install those dependencies and manage your virtual environment ([Poetry installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/), but feel free to use a different way of installing dependencies and managing virtual environments if you have other preferences.

#### Poetry

```shell
poetry install
poetry shell
```

Poetry will install all your dependencies in a newly created virtual environment. To verify that everything works correctly you can run the following command:

```shell
poetry run python3 -c "import flwr"
```

If you don't see any errors you're good to go!

#### pip

Write the command below in your terminal to install the dependencies according to the configuration file requirements.txt.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Federating the Variational Autoencoder Model

Afterwards you are ready to start the Flower server as well as the clients. You can simply start the server in a terminal as follows:

```shell
poetry run python3 server.py
```

Now you are ready to start the Flower clients which will participate in the learning. To do so simply open two more terminals and run the following command in each:

```shell
poetry run python3 client.py
```

Alternatively you can run all of it in one shell as follows:

```shell
poetry run python3 server.py &
poetry run python3 client.py &
poetry run python3 client.py
```

You will see that the federated training of variational autoencoder has started. You can add `steps_per_epoch=3` to `model.fit()` if you just want to evaluate that everything works without having to wait for the client-side training to finish (this will save you a lot of time during development).
