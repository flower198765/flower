    "Then keen-eyed among you might have realised that if we were to fuse the client's `fit()` and `evaluate()` methods, we'll end up with essentially the same as in the `run_centralised()` function we used in the Centralised Training part of this tutorial. And it is true!! In Federated Learning, the way clients perform local training makes use of the same principles as more traditional centralised setup. The key difference is that the dataset now is much smaller and it's never _\"seen\"_ by the entity running the FL workload (i.e. the central server).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about the central server... we should define what strategy we want to make use of so the updated models sent from the clients back to the server at the end of the `fit()` method are aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing a Flower Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy sits at the core of the Federated Learning experiment. It is involved in all stages of a FL pipeline: sampling clients; sending the _global model_ to the clients so they can do `fit()`; receive the updated models from the clients and **aggregate** these to construct a new _global model_; define and execute global or federated evaluation; and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flower comes with [many strategies built-in](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/src/py/flwr/server/strategy) and more to be available in the next release (`1.5` already!). For this tutorial, let's use what is arguable the most popular strategy out there: `FedAvg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way `FedAvg` works is simple but performs surprisingly well in practice. It is therefore one good strategy to start your experimentation. `FedAvg`, as its name implies, derives a new version of the _global model_ by taking the average of all the models sent by clients participating in the round. You can read all the details [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can define `FedAvg` using Flower. We use one of the callbacks called `evaluate_fn` so we can easily evaluate the state of the global model using a small centralised testset. Note this functionality is user-defined since it requires a choice in terms of ML-framework. (if you recall, Flower is framework agnostic).\n",
    "\n",
    "> This being said, centralised evaluation of the global model is only possible if there exists a centralised dataset that somewhat follows a similar distribution as the data that's spread across clients. In some cases having such centralised dataset for validation is not possible, so the only solution is to federate the evaluation of the _global model_. This is the default behaviour in Flower. If you don't specify teh `evaluate_fn` argument in your strategy, then, centralised global evaluation won't be performed."

This function is relatively simple and only requires as input argument the round at which the FL experiment is at. In this example we simply return a Python dictionary to specify the number of epochs and learning rate each client should made use of inside their `fit()` methods. A more versatile implementation would add more hyperparameters (e.g. the learning rate) and adjust them as the FL process advances (e.g. reducing the learning rate in later FL rounds).\n",
